title: "Wormhole Wanderings - Connecting distant ideas through *brain*-time shortcuts"
---

- *Can mechanistic interpretability help us jailbreak black box models?* (kinda)

- *Can a general HotFlip solve adversarial attacks against IDS issues?* (on it, seems possible)

- *Is unlearning un-unlearnable using circuit identification?* (soon)

- *Can we detect backdoors in NN using thermodynamics (and mech interp)?*

- *Can Coq & graphs help us train a "reasoning" model?*

This website (or should I say, this quantum foam where pages appear out of nowhere, and bubble out without warning) brings together a few snippets of my research, on questions that no-one has asked, linking fields that no-one would go near. But since that's what I like - reading papers all day long and thinking, well, what if I put this idea somewhere else? - and sometimes it works, I've decided to build public it anyway. 

It is still in construction, as I'm waiting to know a bit about Manim before decorating it :eyes:. But you can already checkout:
