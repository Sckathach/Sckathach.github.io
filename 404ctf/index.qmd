        The 404 CTF is France's largest cybersecurity competition. It is organized jointly by the [DGSE](https://www.dgse.gouv.fr), [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu), [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org), [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com) and [Viva Technology](https://vivatechnology.com). The 2024 edition took place from April 20 to May 12 2024 and gathered about 3800 competitors around 72 challenges designed by HackademINT.

## AI and Quantum Challenges

For the 2024 edition, I've created **Quantum** and **AI challenges** to introduce participants to these two _fantastic worlds!_

I started with an **introduction to quantum algorithms** based on the framework of the French start-up Quandela, which uses photonics. This was particularly well suited to talking about Quantum Key Distribution, a quantum communication protocol that is very interesting from a cyber security point of view. I also took the opportunity to show them that you can also have fun reverse engineering quantum circuits, and this time no assembly involved I _swear_ :).

I then took a specific area of AI attacks, **model poisoning**, and decided to turn it into a suite of challenges. Unfortunately I didn't have time to release my two difficult challenges, which were really nice :(, but there's still an introduction followed by two small beginner challenges.
