# About
Hi, I'm Thomas! I'm currently an M2 mathematics student at Télécom SudParis and ENS Paris-Saclay, and soon, an AI researcher.

I began doing research in AI security two years ago. After taking a gap year, where I studied Large Language Model (LLM) security and LLM interpretability, I’m now turning my attention toward more fundamental AI. I also love graph theory and physics.

My favorite paper: [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html).

## Education 
- 2025 - 2026 - **Master MVA, ENS Paris-Saclay** \
    Topology, optimal transport, reinforcement learning, training and deploying large-scale models, LLM, graph neural networks, learning for protein science, convex optimization.

- 2022 - 2026 - **Engineering Degree, Télécom SudParis** \
    Telecommunications, cyber security, cloud, information theory, probability, optimization, graph theory, graph neural networks, signal processing.

## Experience

- Sep 2025 - _now_ - **Teaching and research sprints - [PIAF](https://piaf-saclay.org/)** \
    Teaching (interpretability, LLM training and fine-tuning) and organizing short research sprints (teams of ~5 people, lasting under four days).

- Jul - Sep 2025 - **Research internship in LLM security - [NICT](https://csl.nict.go.jp/en/)** \
    Research on the security and jailbreak interpretability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). _I studied LRM robustness, adapted state-of-the-art black-box and white-box attack from LLMs, and started studying jailbreaks with interpretability methods on LRMs._ 

- Mar - May 2025 - **Research internship in AI explanability - [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/antique)** \
    Verified robust explanation for language models. _I explored scaling Hybrid Constrained Zonotopes (HCZs) to language models using convex relaxation and optimization. However, the relaxation error proved too large for practical use._ 

- Jul - Dec 2024 - **Research internship in AI security - [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en)** \
    Implementations and improvements of state-of-the-art attacks on LLMs. _I improved state-of-the-art white-box adversarial attacks on LLMs and published the results on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06269)._

- 2022 - 2024 - **Teaching and infrastructure - [HackademINT](https://www.hackademint.org/)** \
    Teaching (cloud and AI security), cloud management (Kubernetes), creation of challenges (AI & quantum physics), and organization of 404CTF 2023 & 2024 (largest cyber security competition in France).

## Miscellaneous 

- Languages: **Python, [French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette_(pain)), OCaml, English**, Typst, TypeScript, Lua, Rust, C, Bash, Japanese (JLPT 4), Lean.
- Tools/ Frameworks: **PyTorch**, **nnsight**, Docker (Podman), Kubernetes, React, Qiskit, Archlinux.
- Other interests: Piano, guitar, teaching, reading, geopolitics, particle physics, sports, video game (playing & development), meditation.
- I completed the Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator (ARENA) and the AI Safety Fundamental (AISF) curriculums.
