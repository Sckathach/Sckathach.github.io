# \$ Whoami

Aka _the quantum warlock, the masked camel, the fanOfThermodynamics, the pipe and clouds engineer, the whale orchestra conductor_, or just **Sckathach**. I'm a french student at Télécom SudParis, and soon, a ML(4SEC) researcher!

I love mathematics, physics, graphs theory, AI, cybersecurity, graphs, geopolitics, thermodynamics (yes, I swear), programming, and especially graphs.

I'm currently fan of **mechanistic interpretability**, but there is a high risk I become fan of _SLT_ instead.

My favorite paper (asof December 2024) : [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html).

Social media I use arranged in descending exponential order:

- GitHub / Sckathach
- Discord 
- LinkedIN / thomas-winninger
- X / sckathach
