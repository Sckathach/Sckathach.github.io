	abstract = {Large Language Models ({LLMs}) are increasingly used in applications where the model selects from competing third-party content, such as in {LLM}-powered search engines or chatbot plugins. In this paper, we introduce Preference Manipulation Attacks, a new class of attacks that manipulate an {LLM}’s selections to favor the attacker. We demonstrate that carefully crafted website content or plugin documentations can trick an {LLM} to promote the attacker products and discredit competitors, thereby increasing user traffic and monetization. We show this can lead to a prisoner’s dilemma, where all parties are incentivized to launch attacks, but this collectively degrades the {LLM}’s outputs for everyone. We demonstrate our attacks on production {LLM} search engines (Bing and Perplexity) and plugin {APIs} (for {GPT}-4 and Claude). As {LLMs} are increasingly used to rank third-party content, we expect Preference Manipulation Attacks to emerge as a significant threat.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in Large Language Models ({LLMs}) enable exciting {LLM}-integrated applications, which perform textbased tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as {LLMs} have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model to deviate from the original application’s instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the {LLM}’s ability to follow instructions and inability to separate the prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained {LLM} that can produce highquality outputs from these inputs. The {LLM} is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instructiontuned) {LLM} to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released here.},

@article{paulus_advprompter_2024,
	title = {{AdvPrompter}: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for {LLMs}},
	shorttitle = {{AdvPrompter}},
	abstract = {While recently Large Language Models ({LLMs}) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the {TargetLLM}, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another {LLM}, called the {AdvPrompter}, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, \${\textbackslash}sim800{\textbackslash}times\$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the {AdvPrompter} using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the {TargetLLM}. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the {AdvPrompter} predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the {AdvPrompter} with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained {AdvPrompter} generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the {TargetLLM} is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source {TargetLLMs} show state-of-the-art results on the {AdvBench} dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box {LLM} {APIs}. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by {AdvPrompter}, {LLMs} can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high {MMLU} scores.},

	abstract = {As {AI} systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other {AIs}. We experiment with methods for training a harmless {AI} assistant through selfimprovement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as ‘Constitutional {AI}’. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then ﬁnetune the original model on revised responses. In the {RL} phase, we sample from the ﬁnetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of {AI} preferences. We then train with {RL} using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use ‘{RL} from {AI} Feedback’ ({RLAIF}). As a result we are able to train a harmless but nonevasive {AI} assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the {SL} and {RL} methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of {AI} decision making. These methods make it possible to control {AI} behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {As an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in transforming basic orientation information into higher-ordered object representations. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the encoding of simple, complex and intermediate features in V4 remain poorly understood. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we recorded the responses of large populations of V4 neurons to thousands of natural images. To understand these high-dimensional data sets, we performed dimensional reduction analysis on the neuronal population responses. We found orthogonal dimensions encoding orientation and more complex features, with curves and corners represented separately. These distinct feature dimensions were encoded by spatially clustered subpopulations of neurons organized in iso-orientation and curvature domains. Using synthetic stimuli, we confirmed that curvature and corner selective neurons in V4 were tuned to integral features rather than combinations of local orientation compartments. Our results show that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains separate from orientation. This functionally specific population architecture may serve to facilitate local computations that expedite more complex shape and object representations at higher levels of the ventral pathway.},
